# Bolg_website_Flask
This is the complete blog website using #flask #backend
In this repo, i'm going to create the back-end for our application using Flask, and I’ll be creating the front-end using HTML,CSS and bbotstrap.
## Requirements for the back-end:
Python (I’m using version 3.9.0)
Text-editor (I’m using Pycharm,you can use any suitable)
Create your application directory, and add folders and files in your application directories so that the application directory looks like this:
- Hello-flask-Blog
  - static
    - assets
    - css
    - js
  - templates
    - about.html
    - contact.html
    - index.html
    - post.html
    - header.html
    - footer.html
  - venv
  - main.py
  - requirements.txt
   
   

The first thing which comes in our mind when we think of creating a personal blogging website is to use any CMS to do most of the work for you.
Although content management systems provide a quick and easy way to set up a blogging website, adding custom features and look to one’s website becomes tricky.

For web developers like me, it’s always exciting to code a blog since it gives me complete authority over my website.

Yes, the process of creating a personal blogging website from scratch can be tedious, but also, especially as a newbie developer, 
it can be a great learning experience.
